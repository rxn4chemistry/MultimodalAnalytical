                        Spectroscopic techniques are essential tools for determining the structure of molecules. Different spectroscopic techniques, such as Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Infrared spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry, provide insight into the molecular structure, including the presence or absence of functional groups. Chemists leverage the complementary nature of the different methods to their advantage. However, the lack of a comprehensive multimodal dataset, containing spectra from a variety of spectroscopic techniques, has limited machine-learning approaches mostly to single-modality tasks for predicting molecular structures from spectra. Here we introduce a dataset comprising simulated 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HSQC-NMR, Infrared, and Mass spectra (positive and negative ion modes) for 790k molecules extracted from chemical reactions in patent data. This dataset enables the development of foundation models for integrating information from multiple spectroscopic modalities, emulating the approach employed by human experts. Additionally, we provide benchmarks for evaluating single-modality tasks such as structure elucidation, predicting the spectra for a target molecule, and functional group predictions. This dataset has the potential automate structure elucidation, streamlining the molecular discovery pipeline from synthesis to structure determination.

                        The application of machine learning models in chemistry has made remarkable strides in recent years. While analytical chemistry has received considerable interest from machine learning practitioners, its adoption into everyday use remains limited. Among the available analytical methods, Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands out in terms of affordability, simplicity, and accessibility. However, its use has been limited to the identification of a selected few functional groups, as most peaks lie beyond human interpretation. We present a transformer model that enables chemists to leverage the complete information contained within an IR spectrum to directly predict the molecular structure. To cover a large chemical space, we pretrain the model using 634,585 simulated IR spectra and fine-tune it on 3,453 experimental spectra. Our approach achieves a top–1 accuracy of 44.4% and top–10 accuracy of 69.8% on compounds containing 6 to 13 heavy atoms. When solely predicting scaffolds, the model accurately predicts the top-1 scaffold in 84.5% and among the top-10 in 93.0% of cases.

                        Automated structure elucidation from infrared (IR) spectra represents a significant breakthrough in analytical chemistry, having recently gained momentum through the application of Transformer-based language models. In this work, we improve our original Transformer architecture, refine spectral data representations, and implement novel augmentation and decoding strategies to significantly increase performance. We report a Top–1 accuracy of 63.79% and a Top–10 accuracy of 83.95% compared to the current performance of state-of-the-art models of 53.56% and 80.36%, respectively. Our findings not only set a new performance benchmark but also strengthen confidence in the promising future of AI-driven IR spectroscopy as a practical and powerful tool for structure elucidation.

                        The application of machine learning models in chemistry has made remarkable strides in recent years. Even though there is considerable interest in automating common proce- dure in analytical chemistry using machine learning, very few models have been adopted into everyday use. Among the analytical instruments available to chemists, Nuclear Mag- netic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important, offering insights into molecular structure unobtainable with other methods. However, most processing and analysis of NMR spectra is still performed manually, making the task tedious and time consuming especially for larger quantities of spectra. We present a transformer-based machine learning model capable of predicting the molecular structure directly from the NMR spectrum. Our model is pretrained on synthetic NMR spectra, achieving a top–1 accuracy of 67.0% when predicting the structure from both the 1H and 13C spectrum. Additionally, we train a model which, given a spectrum and a set of likely compounds, selects the one corresponding to the spectrum. This model achieves a top–1 accuracy of 96.0% when trained on 1H spectra.

                        Phosphorus-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31P-NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing phosphorus-containing compounds in diverse chemical en- vironments. However, spectral interpretation remains a time-consuming and expertise- dependent task, relying on reference tables and empirical comparisons. In this study, we introduce a data-driven approach that automates 31P-NMR spectral analysis, pro- viding rapid and accurate predictions of local phosphorus environments. By leveraging a curated dataset of experimental and synthetic spectra, our model achieves a Top–1 accuracy of 53.64% and a Top-5 accuracy of 77.69% at predicting the local environment around a phosphorous atom. Furthermore, it demonstrates robustness across differ- ent solvent conditions and outperforms expert chemists by 25% in spectral assignment tasks. The models, datasets, and architecture are openly available, facilitating seam- less adoption in chemical laboratories engaged in structure elucidation, with the goal of advancing 31P-NMR spectral analysis and interpretation.

                        The construction of predictive models in molecular science increasingly relies on large, high-quality datasets. Synthetic data generation is becoming a foundational strategy for advancing model accuracy and enabling fast discovery workflows. To support the development of structure elucidation and spectral property prediction models, we present a comprehensive synthetic dataset of infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for a diverse ensemble of organic molecules. The data were generated using a hybrid computational approach that integrates molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and machine learning (ML) models. The dataset primarily consists of IR spectra for 177,461 molecules, derived from long-timescale MD simulations with ML-accelerated dipole moment predictions. In addition, it includes a smaller subset of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR chemical shifts for 1,255 molecules. This unique combination of spectral data offers a valuable resource for benchmarking and validating computational methodologies, developing and enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) models for molecular property prediction, and facilitating the interpretation of experimental spectroscopic results. The dataset is publicly available through Zenodo, encouraging its broad utilization within the scientific community.
